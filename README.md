Finally out of all of the github issues / stack overflow posts THIS was the solution - thanks @thomashagstrom!

To summarise for future devs / future me...

Close Android Studio
Run ./gradlew --stop to stop any running gradle daemons
If you're using nvm to manage your node versions, run nvm use to ensure your shell is using the right version
Run open -a /Applications/Android\ Studio.app (if you're using the version installed via JetBrains Toolbox, change the path accordingly)
Invalidate caches & restart Android Studio
Run the app - you should see no node errors ðŸŽ‰
